### Preparation Instructions:  

1. **Marinate the Beef:**
   - In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, green onions, sesame seeds, gochujang (if using), rice vinegar, and black pepper. Stir well.
   - Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade and mix to coat the beef evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to overnight for more flavor).

2. **Cook the Rice:**
   - Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - In a pot, combine the rinsed rice, 4 cups of water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for another 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

3. **Stir-Fry the Vegetables:**
   - In a large skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. 
   - Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
   - Add the chopped napa cabbage, julienned carrots, sliced bell peppers, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.
   - Pour in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, stirring to combine. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat.

4. **Cook the Beef:**
   - In the same skillet or a separate grill pan, add the marinated beef in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) and cook over medium-high heat for about 4-5 minutes, or until the beef is cooked through and slightly caramelized. 

### Serving Suggestions:  
- Serve the bulgogi beef on a large platter alongside the stir-fried vegetables.  
- Place a bowl of fluffy jasmine rice in the center.  
- For a fun and interactive meal, provide lettuce leaves for wrapping the beef and vegetables, adding a spoonful of rice inside.  
- Offer kimchi and sliced cucumbers with sesame dressing as refreshing sides.  
- Garnish with extra green onions and sesame seeds for added color and flavor.
