      "title": "1. Argylle",
      "content": "Budget: $200 million  \nBox Office Earnings: Approximately $45 million  \n\nDirected by Matthew Vaughn and featuring an ensemble cast including Henry Cavill and Sam Rockwell, \"Argylle\" was positioned as a high-stakes action thriller. However, it struggled to find its footing at the box office, grossing only about a quarter of its production budget. Critics pointed to a confusing marketing campaign and mixed reviews, which likely alienated potential viewers. Many felt that despite its star power, the film lacked a compelling narrative to draw in audiences."

      "title": "2. Lisa Frankenstein",
      "content": "Budget: $13 million  \nBox Office Earnings: $9.77 million  \n\nThis horror-comedy starring Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton was released to little fanfare and even less box office success. Despite a modest budget, \"Lisa Frankenstein\" grossed just under $10 million, barely covering its costs. Critics lambasted its lackluster script and unoriginal premise, while the marketing efforts failed to generate significant buzz. The mix of horror and teen comedy didn’t resonate with audiences, leading to its unfortunate fate."

      "title": "3. Madame Web",
      "content": "Budget: $80 million  \nBox Office Earnings: $43.82 million  \n\nPart of Sony's Spider-Man Universe, \"Madame Web\" was anticipated to perform well due to its connection to the beloved franchise. However, it fell flat, earning less than half of its production budget. Critics were skeptical about the character's appeal outside of Spider-Man lore, and the film's convoluted plot deterred audiences. Despite Dakota Johnson's leading role, the film could not find an audience in a saturated superhero market."
