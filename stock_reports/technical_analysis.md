  - Conversely, if the stock tests the support level and fails to hold, a retraction towards **$210.00** may be anticipated.

#### Conclusion
Investors should remain vigilant regarding Appleâ€™s stock movements, especially given the mixed market sentiment fueled by recent developments such as optimism in AI opportunities and regulatory changes, alongside concerns over valuation and significant stock sales by major stakeholders like Berkshire Hathaway. Monitoring these technical indicators along with market news will be crucial in making informed investment decisions in the near term. 

Overall, while there are opportunities for growth, caution is warranted due to the high P/E ratio and prevailing market conditions that could lead to increased volatility in Apple's stock price.
