      "While blockbusters “Dune: Part Two” and “Inside Out 2” rode the coattails of their prequels to become the top two highest grossing movies so far this year, a much greater list of Hollywood hopefuls failed to perform in the U.S., including thrillers, horrors and comedies.\n",

      "Key Facts\n",
      "The worst-performing major release of the first six months of 2024 was Focus Features’ horror romance film “Lisa Frankenstein” (Forbes tracked the lowest-grossing major releases that played at over 3,000 theaters).\n",

      "Among the major flops were several big-budget action movies, including “Madame Web,” the poorly reviewed Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson superhero feature with a reported $80 million budget, and Universal Pictures’ “Argylle,” which fell just out the top 10 list after grossing $45.21 million despite a reported $200 million budget.\n",

      "Key Background\n",
      "2024 has been a rough year for Hollywood studios still recovering from the Covid-era box office doldrums, especially as streaming platforms increasingly compete with theaters. Comscore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said last month he believes this summer’s box office gross could fall $800 million below last summer, which raked in over $4 billion—the most since the pandemic. Last year’s Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes also stunted the summer box office, pushing the release date of several major films from 2024 to 2025, notably Paramount’s upcoming sequel to its “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n",
      "Tangent\n",
      "Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1,” the long-awaited first installment of Costner’s western epic, grossed just over $11 million from its June 28 release through June 30, according to Box Office Mojo. While that performance would put it second on the list of worst-performing movies of the first half of the year, it does not appear on the list because it has only been in theaters for a single weekend, and its domestic gross is expected to grow from its underwhelming start.\n",
      "What To Watch For\n",
      "Several major releases out last month are expected to become some of the highest-grossing movies of the year, including Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2,” which boasted a $155 million U.S. opening—the biggest since “Barbie”—and Will Smith’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” which posted an impressive $56 million in its opening weekend last month, far surpassing expectations. Other upcoming releases include Eddie Murphy’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3), horror “MaXXXine” (July 5), “Fly Me to the Moon” (July 12), “Twisters” (July 19) and “Deadpool and Wolverine” (July 26).\n",

The entire domestic box office pulled in just $126 million — in years past, the No. 1 movie alone has made as much as $160 million, as \"Top Gun: Maverick\" did in 2022.A few factors have led to this. Mainly, the WGA/SAG strikes last year put many productions on pause, so some of the bigger movies won't come out until later in the year.\n",

      "Another factor is streaming and VOD. \"Furiosa,\" which came out a little over six weeks ago, is already available to rent at home. For a family, it's cheaper to spend $30 to rent something at home than $50-plus on tickets, snacks, and drinks.And finally, people apparently just aren't convinced they need to see some of these films on the big screen. Why go see Kevin Costner's new Western when you can watch him in \"Yellowstone\" at home?\n",

      "\"Horizon\" was a huge gamble for its star/director/writer/producer, Kevin Costner. Costner mortgaged his home in Santa Barbara and invested $38 million of his own fortune to fund the film.He also left his lucrative role on the smash-hit TV show \"Yellowstone\" due to scheduling conflicts with \"Horizon.\"It's an ambitious task — Costner sees \"Horizon\" as a four-part series that he planned on releasing over the course of a few months. \"Chapter 1\" was released in June and made $11 million on its first weekend. A rough start for a movie that cost as much as $100 million to make.New Line, its distributor, apparently agreed. \"Chapter 2\" was supposed to hit movie theaters on August 16, but the sequel was pulled from the schedule and now sits in limbo.\n",

      "As The Wrap pointed out, \"Furiosa's\" $32 million opening weekend is the lowest No. 1 total for a Memorial Day Weekend since 1995, when \"Casper\" topped the box office with $22 million.Another depressing stat for the \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" prequel? According to Screen Rant, it had the worst second-week drop of any \"Mad Max\" movie, plunging a staggering 59%.Now, why exactly is \"Furiosa\" flopping so hard? It might be a case of unreasonable expectations. \"Fury Road\" is rightfully hailed as one of the best action movies of all time, but it didn't light the box office on fire at first either. Its domestic opening in 2015 was $42.4 million, ending up at a respectable $380 million worldwide.Also, Anya-Taylor Joy (who plays the titular Furiosa) is famous but not a definite movie star yet — arguably, her big break was for a TV show (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), and her last big cinematic hits (\"Dune: Part Two\" and \"The Menu\") were sold on bigger stars like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Ralph Fiennes.By July, the film hadn't crossed the $175 million mark worldwide.\n",

The other film that opened as counter-programming that weekend was \"The Garfield Movie,\" the second animated adaptation of everyone's favorite grumpy cat.The film, which stars Chris Pratt as Garfield, made just $31 million on its opening weekend. So, between \"Garfield\" and \"Furiosa,\" the top two movies at the box office made a total of $63 million.For context, the No. 1 movie at the box office last Memorial Day weekend was \"The Little Mermaid,\" which made $118 million.After the billion-dollar success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (also starring Pratt), \"Garfield\" simply couldn't measure up. The other big animated movie of the year, \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" opened to $57 million and has made $541 million worldwide.When \"Inside Out 2\" was released, that's when it was truly curtains for Garfield.

At this point, it's made $177 million worldwide.As Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio noted before the film premiered, this May was the first time in 17 years (excluding 2020) that a Marvel movie of some kind hasn't kicked off the summer. Last May's Marvel film, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" made $118 million domestically in its opening weekend.With that looming over its head, it's no surprise that \"The Fall Guy,\" based on the little-remembered '80s TV show of the same name, couldn't measure up.\n",

Jackson, comedy icon Catherine O'Hara, beloved actor Bryan Cranston, and current pop star Dua Lipa couldn't crack $100 million at the box-office.Compare that to the $200 million it cost Apple to make, as reported by Indiewire, and that's a true box-office bomb, even if Apple claims otherwise.\n",

      "If you're unfamiliar with the Sony Spider-Man Universe (or the SSU), here's a quick explanation: Marvel (and, therefore, Disney) now owns the rights to almost all of its comic characters. The one property it can't get back? Spider-Man and all his related villains, friends, and love interests, which are still owned by Sony.Although Sony and Disney have agreed on a deal that allows Spidey to appear in the MCU, Sony is still holding tight to the rest of his associates, which is how we end up with films like \"Venom,\" \"Morbius,\" \"Kraven the Hunter,\" and yes, \"Madame Web.\"Why Sony thought this movie was a good idea is beyond us — Madame Web is a little-known character (and matters even less without, you know, Spider-Man around to help save the day), and star Dakota Johnson hasn't proven herself to be a cinematic draw outside IP-driven properties like \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which made a combined $1.3 billion worldwide.With a dismal worldwide box office of $100 million, all that the SSU has proven is that these movies make for good memes.\n",

He began starring in \"The Witcher\" in 2019 (a very successful show by all accounts), only to leave after season three. It's never been officially announced why he left, but the timing did line up with his cameo as Superman in the DCEU film \"Black Adam\" in 2022.Unfortunately for Cavill, when James Gunn took over the DC film division, he announced his plans to scrap the entire DCEU (DC Extended Universe) and start fresh with a brand-new Superman, now played by David Corenswet.And now, Cavill's last two films since his last appearance as Superman in \"The Flash\" have bombed.\n",

      "Key Background\n",
      "2024 has been a rough year for Hollywood studios still recovering from the Covid-era box office doldrums, especially as streaming platforms increasingly compete with theaters. Comscore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said last month he believes this summer’s box office gross could fall $800 million below last summer, which raked in over $4 billion—the most since the pandemic. Last year’s Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes also stunted the summer box office, pushing the release date of several major films from 2024 to 2025, notably Paramount’s upcoming sequel to its “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n",
      "Tangent\n",
      "Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1,” the long-awaited first installment of Costner’s western epic, grossed just over $11 million from its June 28 release through June 30, according to Box Office Mojo. While that performance would put it second on the list of worst-performing movies of the first half of the year, it does not appear on the list because it has only been in theaters for a single weekend, and its domestic gross is expected to grow from its underwhelming start.\n",
      "What To Watch For\n",
      "Several major releases out last month are expected to become some of the highest-grossing movies of the year, including Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2,” which boasted a $155 million U.S. opening—the biggest since “Barbie”—and Will Smith’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” which posted an impressive $56 million in its opening weekend last month, far surpassing expectations. Other upcoming releases include Eddie Murphy’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3), horror “MaXXXine” (July 5), “Fly Me to the Moon” (July 12), “Twisters” (July 19) and “Deadpool and Wolverine” (July 26).\n",

      "This year has not been great for the box office. In fact, Memorial Day was the worst weekend for the movies since the '90s. The entire domestic box office pulled in just $126 million — in years past, the No. 1 movie alone has made as much as $160 million, as \"Top Gun: Maverick\" did in 2022.A few factors have led to this. Mainly, the WGA/SAG strikes last year put many productions on pause, so some of the bigger movies won't come out until later in the year.\n",

      "Another factor is streaming and VOD. \"Furiosa,\" which came out a little over six weeks ago, is already available to rent at home. For a family, it's cheaper to spend $30 to rent something at home than $50-plus on tickets, snacks, and drinks.And finally, people apparently just aren't convinced they need to see some of these films on the big screen. Why go see Kevin Costner's new Western when you can watch him in \"Yellowstone\" at home?\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Not all movies have bombed this year — \"Inside Out 2\" has pulled in $1.2 billion worldwide, a record for Pixar, Forbes reported — but these films performed much worse than anticipated.\n",

      "\"Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1.\"\n",
      " New Line Cinema\n",
      "\"Horizon\" was a huge gamble for its star/director/writer/producer, Kevin Costner. Costner mortgaged his home in Santa Barbara and invested $38 million of his own fortune to fund the film.He also left his lucrative role on the smash-hit TV show \"Yellowstone\" due to scheduling conflicts with \"Horizon.\"It's an ambitious task — Costner sees \"Horizon\" as a four-part series that he planned on releasing over the course of a few months. \"Chapter 1\" was released in June and made $11 million on its first weekend. A rough start for a movie that cost as much as $100 million to make.New Line, its distributor, apparently agreed. \"Chapter 2\" was supposed to hit movie theaters on August 16, but the sequel was pulled from the schedule and now sits in limbo.\n",

      "\"Furiosa\" opened to a bleak $32 million over the four-day Memorial Day Weekend.\n",
      "Anya Taylor-Joy in \"Furiosa.\"\n",
      " Warner Bros.\n",
      "As The Wrap pointed out, \"Furiosa's\" $32 million opening weekend is the lowest No. 1 total for a Memorial Day Weekend since 1995, when \"Casper\" topped the box office with $22 million.Another depressing stat for the \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" prequel? According to Screen Rant, it had the worst second-week drop of any \"Mad Max\" movie, plunging a staggering 59%.Now, why exactly is \"Furiosa\" flopping so hard? It might be a case of unreasonable expectations. \"Fury Road\" is rightfully hailed as one of the best action movies of all time, but it didn't light the box office on fire at first either. Its domestic opening in 2015 was $42.4 million, ending up at a respectable $380 million worldwide.Also, Anya-Taylor Joy (who plays the titular Furiosa) is famous but not a definite movie star yet — arguably, her big break was for a TV show (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), and her last big cinematic hits (\"Dune: Part Two\" and \"The Menu\") were sold on bigger stars like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Ralph Fiennes.By July, the film hadn't crossed the $175 million mark worldwide.\n",

      "We can't only blame \"Furiosa\" for the abysmal Memorial Day box office. The other film that opened as counter-programming that weekend was \"The Garfield Movie,\" the second animated adaptation of everyone's favorite grumpy cat.The film, which stars Chris Pratt as Garfield, made just $31 million on its opening weekend. So, between \"Garfield\" and \"Furiosa,\" the top two movies at the box office made a total of $63 million.For context, the No. 1 movie at the box office last Memorial Day weekend was \"The Little Mermaid,\" which made $118 million.After the billion-dollar success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (also starring Pratt), \"Garfield\" simply couldn't measure up. The other big animated movie of the year, \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" opened to $57 million and has made $541 million worldwide.When \"Inside Out 2\" was released, that's when it was truly curtains for Garfield. The Pixar sequel has already made $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing movie of the year.\n",

      " Universal\n",
      "An action rom-com led by the two of the stars of last year's box-office phenomenon, Barbenheimer? You'd think that'd be a no-brainer smash, but \"The Fall Guy\" hasn't lived up to those lofty expectations.Variety reported that the film was projected to debut between $30 and $40 million, but it made just $28.5 million. At this point, it's made $177 million worldwide.As Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio noted before the film premiered, this May was the first time in 17 years (excluding 2020) that a Marvel movie of some kind hasn't kicked off the summer. Last May's Marvel film, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" made $118 million domestically in its opening weekend.With that looming over its head, it's no surprise that \"The Fall Guy,\" based on the little-remembered '80s TV show of the same name, couldn't measure up.\n",

      "Put aside the deeply annoying \"Who is the real Agent Argylle?\" marketing campaign and think about how wild this is: \"Argylle,\" an action spy-thriller starring Oscar-winner Sam Rockwell, former Superman Henry Cavill, the former star of a multi-billion-dollar franchise Bryce Dallas Howard, living legend Samuel L. Jackson, comedy icon Catherine O'Hara, beloved actor Bryan Cranston, and current pop star Dua Lipa couldn't crack $100 million at the box-office.Compare that to the $200 million it cost Apple to make, as reported by Indiewire, and that's a true box-office bomb, even if Apple claims otherwise.\n",

      "If you're unfamiliar with the Sony Spider-Man Universe (or the SSU), here's a quick explanation: Marvel (and, therefore, Disney) now owns the rights to almost all of its comic characters. The one property it can't get back? Spider-Man and all his related villains, friends, and love interests, which are still owned by Sony.Although Sony and Disney have agreed on a deal that allows Spidey to appear in the MCU, Sony is still holding tight to the rest of his associates, which is how we end up with films like \"Venom,\" \"Morbius,\" \"Kraven the Hunter,\" and yes, \"Madame Web.\"Why Sony thought this movie was a good idea is beyond us — Madame Web is a little-known character (and matters even less without, you know, Spider-Man around to help save the day), and star Dakota Johnson hasn't proven herself to be a cinematic draw outside IP-driven properties like \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which made a combined $1.3 billion worldwide.With a dismal worldwide box office of $100 million, all that the SSU has proven is that these movies make for good memes.\n",

      "\"The First Omen\" is by no means a huge disappointment for 20th Century Studios — it's made $53 million worldwide against a $30 million budget — but it wasn't the hit you might've expected from one of the most iconic franchises in horror history.Variety even reported that projections expected the film to make $14 to $15 million on opening weekend. It made a little over half that: just $8.3 million.\n",

He began starring in \"The Witcher\" in 2019 (a very successful show by all accounts), only to leave after season three. It's never been officially announced why he left, but the timing did line up with his cameo as Superman in the DCEU film \"Black Adam\" in 2022.Unfortunately for Cavill, when James Gunn took over the DC film division, he announced his plans to scrap the entire DCEU (DC Extended Universe) and start fresh with a brand-new Superman, now played by David Corenswet.And now, Cavill's last two films since his last appearance as Superman in \"The Flash\" have bombed.\n",

His first, \"The Harder They Fall,\" was a critical success and enjoyed by viewers, but it debuted on Netflix, so it was hard to gauge what the box office would be like for his follow-up.It turns out that biblical comedy doesn't go over as well as a Western.

      "\n",
      "2024 has proven to be a challenging year for Hollywood, with several films failing to meet box office expectations despite significant budgets and star-studded casts. Here are three of the most notable box office flops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lisa Frankenstein**\n",
      "   - **Budget**: $13 million\n",
      "   - **Box Office Earnings**: $9.77 million\n",
      "   - **Critical Reception**: 51% on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
      "   - **Reasons for Poor Performance**: This horror romance film, featuring Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton, struggled to attract audiences despite a relatively low budget. The film's marketing may not have resonated with viewers, and its unique blend of horror and comedy failed to generate sufficient buzz. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Argylle**\n",
      "   - **Budget**: $200 million\n",
      "   - **Box Office Earnings**: $45.21 million\n",
      "   - **Critical Reception**: Mixed reviews; specific score not provided\n",
      "   - **Reasons for Poor Performance**: Starring a high-profile cast including Henry Cavill and Samuel L. Jackson, \"Argylle\" was an ambitious action spy-thriller. However, it was unable to recoup its enormous budget, falling short of expectations. Critics noted that the film's marketing was confusing, and it lacked a strong narrative hook, leading to a lack of interest from audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Madame Web**\n",
      "   - **Budget**: $80 million\n",
      "   - **Box Office Earnings**: $43.82 million\n",
      "   - **Critical Reception**: Generally negative; specific score not provided\n",
      "   - **Reasons for Poor Performance**: This film is part of the Sony Spider-Man Universe but struggled to find its footing. Critics pointed to a lack of compelling characters and a convoluted plot as significant drawbacks. Dakota Johnson's star power was not enough to draw audiences, and many viewers were skeptical about the relevance of the character Madame Web outside of Spider-Man’s universe.\n",
