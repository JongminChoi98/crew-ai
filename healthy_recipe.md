### Preparation Instructions:  

1. **Marinate the Tofu:**
   - In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar (or maple syrup), sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, green onions, sesame seeds, gochujang (if using), rice vinegar, and black pepper. Stir well.
   - Add the thinly sliced tofu to the marinade and gently mix to coat the tofu evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to overnight for more flavor).

2. **Cook the Rice:**
   - Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - In a pot, combine the rinsed rice, 4 cups of water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for another 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

3. **Stir-Fry the Vegetables:**
   - In a large skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. 
   - Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
   - Add the chopped napa cabbage, julienned carrots, sliced bell peppers, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.
   - Pour in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, stirring to combine. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat.

4. **Cook the Tofu:**
   - In the same skillet or a separate grill pan, add the marinated tofu in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) and cook over medium-high heat for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the tofu is golden brown and slightly caramelized. 

### Serving Suggestions:  
- Serve the bulgogi tofu on a large platter alongside the stir-fried vegetables.  
- Place a bowl of fluffy jasmine rice in the center.  
- For a fun and interactive meal, provide lettuce leaves for wrapping the tofu and vegetables, adding a spoonful of rice inside.  
- Offer kimchi and sliced cucumbers with sesame dressing as refreshing sides.  
- Garnish with extra green onions and sesame seeds for added color and flavor.  

Enjoy your delightful vegetarian Korean dinner with family and friends!

### Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:  
- **Beef Sirloin** was replaced with **extra-firm tofu**: Tofu offers a great source of protein and has the ability to absorb flavors, making it an excellent substitute for beef in bulgogi.
- **Brown Sugar** was substituted with **maple syrup**: This is a natural sweetener that provides a similar sweetness with a different flavor profile that complements the dish.
- All other ingredients remain the same, retaining the authentic taste of the dish while ensuring it is vegetarian and delicious.
